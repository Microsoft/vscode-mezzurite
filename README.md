  Mezzurite SDK Extension for Visual Studio Code
  <br>
  <br>
</h1>

This plugin improves the Mezzurite SDK implementation experience.  The Mezzurite SDK provides a consistent way to collect performance metrics of Single Page Applications across a variety of frameworks. Learn more about Mezzurite by visiting our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mezzurite)!

## Features
 
 #### Components Tracking
 Displaying the marked and unmarked components for performance tracking from the application code currently active in editor workspace.

 ####  Modules Tracking
 Displaying the modules configured with mezzurite performance markers to capture ALT and VLT for the application code currently active in editor workspace.

## RoadMap
We are working on to provide the following features:-
 
 #### Intellisense and autocomplete
 Suggestion are provided for mezzurite syntaxes while typing imports and other mezzurite syntaxes. Code completion would be performed automatically while hitting Ctrl+Space on specific syntaxes.
 
 #### Verifying Loggers
 This feature verifies whether logging options for captured metrics is enabled or not. This also provides suggestions on required mandatory properties in logging config.
